# CSI-GSL
We tried to infer the user position in a Massive MIMO communication system. Our results
show that CNN is able to infer the spatial information for all two scenarios, and specifically
there is high accuracy in the URA scenario. We also discovered that GSL can significantly
improve the accuracy of location prediction in real life MIMO communication system where
a large part of labeled data is missing.
